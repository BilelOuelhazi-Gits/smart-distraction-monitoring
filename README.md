# smart-distraction-monitoring
Developed during a 24-hour hackathon on May 11-12, 2025, this real-time distraction monitoring system uses computer vision to track distraction time, hand-on-mouth gestures, blinks, phone use, and posture. Data is stored in MongoDB and shown via a Flask dashboard for users and admins to improve focus and awareness.
